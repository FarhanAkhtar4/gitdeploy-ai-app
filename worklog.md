## Current Project Status
- GitDeploy AI is a comprehensive, production-quality SaaS platform
- Core features: AI Project Builder (with templates, search/filter, card/table views), GitHub Deployment Agent (with real-time status, deployment history), Hosting Advisor (with star ratings, comparison table, setup steps), Deployment Scheduler, Diff Viewer, Command Palette (⌘K), Notifications Panel, File Viewer, Project Health Widget, Workflow Template, API Usage Tracker, Code Review Assistant, Conversation Topics Panel, Context-Aware Chips, Message Reactions, Syntax Highlighting, Environment Variable Manager (encrypted, CRUD, .env import), Breadcrumb Navigation Header
- Database: SQLite with 8 Prisma models
- API: 10 REST endpoints with error handling
- Frontend: 7 views with dark theme, responsive design, 35+ components
- Real-time: Socket.io service on port 3003 with client integration
- Styling: 15+ CSS animations, 30+ utility classes, Framer Motion throughout, glassmorphism effects, mobile-first responsive
- Lint: passes cleanly with zero errors

## Unresolved Issues / Risks
- /api/user returns 404 (demo user not in DB) — mitigated by not overwriting store data
- Socket.io deploy service on port 3003 may not be running — deploy view shows "Offline" status
- Light mode not fully implemented — theme toggle exists but views are hardcoded dark
- Scheduled deployments are UI-only — no actual cron execution
- No URL-based routing — views are client-side only, not bookmarkable
- No real project data seeding in database for demo purposes
- Accessibility: CommandDialog missing DialogTitle

## Priority Recommendations for Next Phase
1. Seed database with demo user and projects for consistent demo experience
2. Implement light mode fully across all views
3. Add URL-based routing for bookmarkable views (/dashboard, /builder, /deploy, etc.)
4. Add actual cron job execution for scheduled deployments
5. Add workflow file generation (deploy.yml template)
6. Improve accessibility (DialogTitle for CommandDialog, ARIA labels)
7. Add WebSocket reconnection logic in deploy view
8. Add drag-and-drop file upload in builder view

5. **Safe area support** — Four directional classes (`.safe-area-bottom`, `.safe-area-top`, `.safe-area-left`, `.safe-area-right`) using env(safe-area-inset-*). Footer elements and [role="contentinfo"] automatically get padding-bottom: env(safe-area-inset-bottom)
6. **Bonus**: iOS text size zoom prevention — inputs and textareas set to font-size: 16px on mobile to prevent automatic zoom
7. **Bonus**: `.mobile-gap` responsive gap utility
